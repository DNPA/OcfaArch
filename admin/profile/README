First start the script using:

./monusage.pl eth0 hda  tempdir
eth0 the ethernet connection
hda the connection to the harddisk whose activities you want to monitor.

tempmpdir should not exist.  
Than start an ocfa run, when finished stop the script with ctrl-c.
After this do:

cd tempdir
../monusage.gnuplot

This will create 3 jpg files in the tempdir
