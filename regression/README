This directory contains a set of 3 python scripts that can be used for regression testing.
Before making a major change to the OCFA code-base or a rule-list, doing an OCFA run
with a test item would create a reference item in the database. After making the major change
the some item is run again, a regressiontest item will be available in the database.
The tools we have in this directory allows us to compare these two items in order to
get a digest of the differences between the two item runs.

The tool OcfaDbDigest.py will create an xml digest of each item in a given database.
Given that there are some modules that are known to produce 'false' or 'instable' meta data
(timestamps of for example the sleuthkit module are set to time of extraction instead of
times on the filesystem that data is being extracted from). To keep this false and instable 
meta out of the digest, the tool has an optional second commandline argument that designates
the location of an 'ignore list'.

If digest xml files are available for both the reference run item and the regression run item,
these two digest files can be compared using two tools.

The tool 'digestcompare.py' will do a shalow compare of all files derived and of the routes these
files followed. Before it starts it will compare the input files of both digests, and will abandon
if these are not exactly the same. 

The tool 'digestcomparedeep.py' will do a deep compare of all meta-data of the intersection of all files
(input and derived).
