Note in the Makefile the references to libPersistentQueue.a

Untill we have a proper installation of PersistenQueue, proceed as
follows;

To build:

cd ../ppq
./build.sh
ar -rs libPersistentQueue.a WriteFile.o ReadFile.o StatusFile.o PersistentPriorityQueue.o PersistentFifo.o

Now you have the library libPersistentQueue.a.

To 'install' :

su -
cd /lib (or some other standard library dir on your system)
ln -s <path to libPersistentQueue.a>

This works for me ...

In the makefile set the path to the headerfiles with -I


Debugging:
In the debugger you need to give the command:
  handle SIGPIPE "nostop"
This will keep the program from breaking on module disconnects.
