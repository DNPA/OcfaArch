How to manage your items.

Deleting items is fairly timeconsuming. To improve the user
experience, a new concept is created. 'Hiding Items'. A hidden item is
still in the database, but should not show up on the user interface
for the tactical investigator. When time is sufficient, the hidden
items can be deleted.

For now it is a wise idea, to make a backup of your database and
repository before using these scripts (Why? Because it is always wise
to make backups).

In order to hide an item you can type:
hideitem <case> <source> <item>

the itemname will change to <itemname> + "hidden" + <date/time> and
the hidden field in the item table will be set to true.

When you have time you can do 'deletehidden' which removes all traces
from the hidden items from the database and also removes all
metastoreentities.


If the you use the new db.sql your items table should have a boolean
field called hidden. If you don't have it (e.g., when you are using it
on an existing case), you can add it by  typing 
alter table item add column hidden boolean default false;.
